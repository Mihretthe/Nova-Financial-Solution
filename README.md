# Nova Financial News Sentiment Analysis

Nova Financial News Sentiment Analysis is a cutting-edge project designed to explore the relationship between financial news sentiment and stock market movements. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and advanced data analytics, this project aims to empower **Nova Financial Solutions** with actionable insights and enhanced predictive capabilities for financial forecasting.

## **Project Description**

This project focuses on analyzing a large corpus of financial news data to identify correlations between news sentiment and stock performance. It is divided into two main tasks:

### **1. Sentiment Analysis**
Analyze the sentiment of financial news headlines to quantify the tone (positive, negative, or neutral). Using NLP techniques, sentiment scores are derived for each news headline, which are then mapped to their corresponding stock symbols to understand the emotional context surrounding stock-related news.

### **2. Correlation Analysis**
Perform statistical analysis to identify relationships between news sentiment and stock price movements. This includes:
- Tracking stock price changes around the publication date of the news articles.
- Measuring the impact of sentiment scores on stock performance.
- Accounting for publication date and, where possible, publication time for enhanced precision.

This analysis will provide insights into how financial news sentiment can serve as a predictive tool for stock market trends.

## **Skills and Technologies**
The project emphasizes three key areas:
- **Data Engineering (DE):** Handling large datasets, cleaning, and preprocessing for analysis.
- **Financial Analytics (FA):** Understanding market behavior and stock performance metrics.
- **Machine Learning Engineering (MLE):** Applying machine learning models for sentiment analysis and predictive analytics.

By completing this project, you'll develop advanced skills in analyzing complex datasets, demonstrating adaptability, and applying innovative thinking to solve real-world financial challenges.

## **Project Features**
- Sentiment analysis of financial news headlines using NLP.
- Correlation analysis of sentiment scores and stock price movements.
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks for detailed insights.
- Actionable insights to guide Nova Financial Solutions in leveraging news sentiment for financial forecasting.
